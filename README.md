Personal Website

This is fundamentally just a personal website/blog for myself.

You can access it at evmaus.github.io.  It's generated using [Jekyll][jekyll-link], but mostly so
that I can version control drafts without posting them publically, I've opted to only post
the static content here.

Any of the contents of posts (text, images, etc.) are copyright Everett Maus, and are available under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (the full license text is [here][content-license] in the 'about' folder, but the cliff notes are also [here][cc-by-nc-sa]).  The exception to this is any code, which is MIT licensed unless otherwiste noted, and which will also be made available in the repository [here][snippets-link].
