Personal Website

This is fundamentally just a personal website/blog for myself.

You can access it at evmaus.github.io.  It's generated using [Jekyll][jekyll-link], but mostly so
that I can version control drafts, only the static content is here.

The posts here are copyright Everett Maus, and licensed under CC BY-NC-SA (the actual license text is 
in the 'about' folder), with the exception of any code, which is MIT licensed and 
also available [here][snippets-link].
